AWS (Amazon Web Services) provides a number of different migration strategies that can be used to move applications and data to the cloud. The most common AWS migration strategies include:

Lift and Shift: This migration strategy involves moving existing applications and data to the cloud without making any changes to the application architecture. This approach is often used for applications that are already running on virtual machines and can be easily moved to the AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

- Re-architecting: This migration strategy involves redesigning the application architecture to take advantage of cloud-native services such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, or Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). This approach is often used for applications that are not well-suited to the lift-and-shift approach or need to be scaled up and down based on demand.

- Hybrid: This migration strategy involves running some components of an application on-premises and others in the cloud. This approach is often used when an application requires specific hardware that is not available in the cloud or when data needs to be kept on-premises for compliance reasons.

- Database Migration: This migration strategy involves moving database from on-premises or other cloud provider to AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) or Aurora. This approach is often used when there is a need for scalable, available, and cost-efficient databases.

- Application Discovery and Analysis: This migration strategy involves discovering and analyzing the applications that are running in your organization, identifying their dependencies and characteristics, and determining the most suitable migration strategy for each application.

AWS provides various services and tools to assist with each of these migration strategies. AWS Application Discovery Service, AWS Database Migration Service, AWS Server Migration Service, AWS Migration Hub, and AWS DataSync are some examples of the services that are provided to help customers with their migration process.

It's worth noting that not all migration strategies will fit every organization and its specific needs and requirements. Choosing the right migration strategy depends on many factors such as current infrastructure, application's architecture, data volume, compliance requirements, and more.
